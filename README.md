This would be my solution for your tech task!

Few things out of the way:
1)I have never used TypeScript before, however I gave it a try during this task. It was really cumbersome at first, however I somewhat grasped the idea of it and managed to make it work, I also totally understand that my implementation of it, does not benefit a lot in this case(using "any" type and probably many more examples that I didnt even realised yet). In general it's hard to go from vanilla JS to TS however the benefits are obvious in bigger scale team and I will definetly look into it more.
2)There are definetly many improvements that could be made: some state refactoring, spliting larger components into smaller ones, making filters like a toggle button(currently it simply filters one or another), maybe branching repository for different components and many more, however I hope this represents my current knowledge well enough, and that it is enough to go further in hiring process (pray)

As request I will also give my honest opinion about the task:

In general I did not expect it to be hard beforehand, however it was harder than expected: especially how to handle fetched data and filtering:
to be more precise I ran into issue of modifying fetched data witth filters(that made me look more into immutability), my current solution is definitely not perfect and I would be very glad to see more insight on how to properly to solve such issue in correct way.
Pagination was not as hard as I expected it to be, but it is most likely due to current implementation simplicity, but it does work, and in my opinion looks pretty good, of course everything can be made better!

The task as whole really touched some important points of Fron't-End developement: from fetching data, looking into render cycle, immutability and others, I did not expect it to be as complex, but I'm really glad it was!
